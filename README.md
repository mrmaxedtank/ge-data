# Ge-data

##Purpose
This project was made to gather market data for the economy of Oldschool Runescape (OSRS). Initially the system was
built to gather data from the official OSRS API (which provides fairly inaccurate data and only updates once a day) 
and from the Osbuddy ge database (an API of a formerly popular 3rd party client for OSRS). 

Later functions to email users when the OSRS database prices were updated were added, as well
as methods for gathering data from the rs wiki, which offers data gathered with
the another 3rd party client called Runelite.

##Installation

##Usage
Schedule script with function call in crontab. I personally ran this script off a
raspberry pi.
